# BigProject
### Institution: Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology - GMIT 
### Course: Higher Diploma in Data Analytics
### Module: Data Representation
### Author: Alexander Pepe

    This project is describing what was taught in the module during the semester.
    
### Objective
The project starts with the creation of the database, so a data access object (DAO) was created to promote the interface with data types. I created the Python server to do this interaction, then I created the HTML so that the user can interact with the database.

This project is avaiable at https://github.com/PepeAlex/BigProject_DataRepresentation, so everyone can clone the files and run in your computer.

## Files
In this project we can view some folders and files. Folders like "staticpages", "venv", "vscode" and _pycache_ have been created; and files called ".gitignore", "dbconfig", "LessonsDAO", "requiremens.txt" and "server_project".

#### staticpages
Inside this folder we can see files related with webpage composed of "lesson.html" (first page), "page1.html" (second page) and folder to support for the creation of web pages     like images and "CSS" files, to give us good layout. 

#### venv
The venv module provides support for creating lightweight “virtual environments” with their own site directories, optionally isolated from system site directories.

#### vscode
The folder contain settings, configuration and debug configuration, so I can share my set to make it easer to open.

#### _pycache_
When you run a program in python, the interpreter compiles it to bytecode first and after compilation interpreter stores it in this folder. These files are bytecode-compiled and   optimized bytecode-compiled versions of your program's files, respectively.
